# cluster-SGC
A new model that use clustering algorithm to improve SGC to make it can deal with large-scale dataset without out-of-memory problem.

Final Project of COMP576 written by Zhen Gao (zg28) Tian (Zan) Zhang (zz93).

Before you run this code, you should install pytorch and METIS first, then download datasets and put them in ./datasets.
